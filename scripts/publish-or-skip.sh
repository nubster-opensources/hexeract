# publish-or-skip.sh: idempotent `cargo publish` wrapper used by the
# release workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/publish-or-skip.sh <crate-name> [extra args] -- <token>
#
# The script:
#   1. Reads the local version of <crate-name> via `cargo pkgid`.
#   2. Checks the crates.io API for that exact version.
#   3. Skips the publish if the version is already on crates.io.
#   4. Otherwise runs `cargo publish -p <crate-name> [extra args] --token <token>`.
#
# Why: the release workflow needs to be re-runnable after a partial
# failure (mid-pipeline timeout, missing intermediate crate, ...).
# Without idempotence, every retry would fail on the already-published
# crates and require a manual version bump.
